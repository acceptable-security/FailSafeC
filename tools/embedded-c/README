NAME

    ec - embedded C processor

SYNOPSIS

    ec [options] [file ...]

      Options:
        -l file                Write process log to file
        --keep-temp-dir        Keep contents of temporary directory after use
        --work-on-current-dir  Generate all temporary files in current directory
        --debug=n              Set debug level (default=1 if -l given, 0 otherwise)
	--cc compiler	       Set name of the C compiler to use
        -h, --help             Show this message

DESCRIPTION

    "ec" reads script from either command-line-specified file or
    standard input.  Basically, contents of the input is copied into
    output.  However, directives enclosed by <% %> is treated as a
    (part of) C statements.  This can be used to conditionally filters
    some of input text, to embed results of some computations into
    output, or to perform anything further complicated things.  In
    addition, <%=fmt exp %> emits the runtime value of the C
    expression "exp", formatted by printf(3) format "%fmt". (it is
    just the shortcut for '<% printf("%fmt", exp); %>'.) The complete
    syntax is described in the file SYNTAX.

    Internally, ec generates a set of C sources which prints the
    contents of the input by fwrite(3).  The statements inside <% %>
    are copied verbatimly into the C sources.  These files are then
    processed by GCC compiler and executed.

OPTIONS

    "-l": it specifies the name of the log file. This file will
    contain all diagnostic or error messages output from compilers.

    "--keep-temp-dir": By default, the temporary sources files and
    executables are generated in a temporary directory, and removed
    when the processing is finished (either succeed or failed).  This
    option prevents the temporary directory to be removed.  The name
    of the temporary directory will be printted.

    "--work-on-current-dir": This inhibits the use of a temporary
    directory.  Instead, all temporary files (named "ec_work_*.c" and
    "ec_work_*.exe", where * is a number starts from 0) are emit to
    the current directory.  This option implies the behaviour of
    --keep-temp-dir, thus these temporary files will remain after
    processing.

    "--debug" sprcifies the debug level of the processor.  Debug level
    1 outputs all messages from compilers (same as those output by
    -l).  The levels more than 1 will not be interesting to casual
    users.  If specified with the "-l" option, the debug messages will
    go to the log file.

SECURITY

    By the nature of the processing, the ec scripts can do anything
    which can be done with the privilege of the running user.  Be very
    careful about processing the files given from other people (as in
    the same way as to execute given shell scripts, Perl/Ruby scripts,
    Makefiles, and others.)

    The script will be executed in the current directory.

    The compiler options specified by <%#cflags#%> and <%#libs#%>
    directives are passed "as is" to the shell which invokes
    compilers. Shell meta characters such as < > or | will be
    interpreted, and some options such as -o may confuse either
    shell or GCC compiler, or both.
