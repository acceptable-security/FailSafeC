Runtime debugging features
================

Binaries compiled with -g option will refer the environment variable
FSC_DEBUG_RUNTIME.  Each characters in the variable will enable
a specific debugging log.

Current set of debugging features are as follows:

a	memory allocator
t	memory type guessing
S	signal handlers, signal-assisted null pointer handler
s	stack unwinding management
v	varargs
m	access Methods (huge output!)
M	memory-mapped regions (mmap, shm)
e	environ treatment
l	other library debug messages
